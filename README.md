# electron-three-js-testing

developinng a minecraft-like game using electron-forge to build it and three.js for graphics

so far in general:  
  -initial electron and three configuration done  
  -electron-forge build runs with npm run make  
  -npm run start to run app  
  
notes for myseslf:  
  -electron 5+ doesn't support webgl so i had to use @4.2.6  
  -to import own node modules they have to be in node_modules folder. otherwise it won't work  
  
game-related  
  -done function to make grid of boxes  
  -still much to be done  
  -now focusing on moving the camera with wasd and mouse
